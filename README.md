# Re-Write

## About

Re-Write is a paraphrasing tool being expanded upon as I delve deeper into machine learning. Developed alongside the Re-Write API, its front-end utilizes the Vue3 javascript framework, while Flask in Python drives the API. 
## Prerequisites

- Node.js & npm
- Python
- Flask
- [Re-Write API setup](https://github.com/DylanHourigan/re_write_api#setup)

## To set up the project and run locally

#### *__Ensure you are running the Re-Write API as it is essential__*

```
npm install

npm run serve
```



## Usage

Once in, you'll access a page featuring the paraphrasing tool. Enter a sentence, press the 'paraphrase' button, and the tool will display a rephrased version below the input area. Switch between available models using the dropdown menu.

There are currently two models available: a standard model and a machine learning-driven one.
